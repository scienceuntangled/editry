`editry` provides R bindings to [editly](https://github.com/mifi/editly/), a "tool and framework for declarative NLE (non-linear video editing) using Node.js and ffmpeg. Editly allows you to easily and programmatically create a video from a set of clips, images, audio and titles, with smooth transitions and music overlaid."


## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/scienceuntangled/editry) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("remotes") ## if needed
remotes::install_github("scienceuntangled/editry")

```

Before `editry` can be used, you also need to install `node`, and the `editly` npm package. You only need to do these steps once.

Install `node`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
noder::nr_install_node()
```

Then `editly`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(editry)
er_install_editly()
```

If you don't have `ffmpeg` on your system, you will also need this. On Windows you can use:
```{r eval = FALSE}
er_install_ffmpeg()
```

On other platforms (Linux, Mac) you will need to install `ffmpeg` yourself, e.g. using your package manager.

## Example usage

The sequence of operations that editly performs to produce a video is called an "edit spec". See the [editly GitHub page](https://github.com/mifi/editly/) for details and examples.

Typically a spec consists of a sequence of clips, along with some header parameters that control aspects of the overall video. Each clip contains one or more layers. Let's start with two simple clips:

```{r}
clips <- list(
    er_clip_title(duration = 3, text = "Title slide", transition = er_transition(name = "windowslice")),
    er_clip_image(duration = 3, path = "https://jeroen.github.io/images/Rlogo.png",
                  resize_mode = "contain", zoom_direction = "out"))

```

The header:

```{r}
outfile <- tempfile(fileext = ".mp4")
hdr <- er_header(out_path = outfile, allow_remote_requests = TRUE)
## allow_remote_requests allows us to use a remote URL for image source, above
```

Now we can build the actual spec (which is a json string):

```{r}
my_json <- er_spec(header = hdr, clips = clips)

```

And compile this into a video. We use the `fast` option here to generate a low-quality preview:

```{r, eval = !file.exists("man/figures/example1.gif")}
er_exec_wait(json = my_json, fast = TRUE)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
if (!file.exists("man/figures/example1.gif")) {
    if (!dir.exists("man/figures")) dir.create("man/figures")
    fls <- av::av_video_images(outfile, format = "png")
    gifski::gifski(fls, gif_file = "man/figures/example1.gif", width = 320, height = 240, delay = 1/30)
}

```
